 * Name: Elements
 * Author: Tom Disque
 * Purpose: To exercise some of the features of Delphi
 *
 * Notes: I retired in 2019 after 42 years of code development, but found that
 *        I was restless after some months.  I decided I'd like to go back to
 *        coding for a few more years, but realized that my skills were too
 *        out of date.  I needed to learn C#, C++, Java, Python, Perl, and the
 *        parts of the full stack that I didn't already know.
 *
 *        I started with C#, using the excellent book "Learn C# in one Day"
 *        by Jamie Chan.  I knew from past experience with classes in Java
 *        that if I didn't start coding in C# right away, I would forget what
 *        I had learned, so I decided on this project.
 *
 *        Since my bachelor in science degree was a double major in chemistry
 *        and computer science, I wanted a project that would involve both
 *        disciplines.  I also wanted To exercise some of the features unique
 *        to other languages as opposed to C.  This code is the result of that
 *        effort.
 *
 *        The basic idea is the the player choose two elements to see if they
 *        will combine with one another; for example, hydrogen combines with
 *        oxygen to create water.  With later iterations, I will make it more
 *        complicated, such as requiring the player to provide two hydrogen
 *        atoms, one oxygen atom, and a spark of energy to cause the reaction
 *        to take place.
 *
 *        Eventually, if all goes well, I can envision a sequel: Compounds,
 *        which would deal with reactions beyond simple elements, such as
 *        mixing sodium bicarbonate with vinegar to create sodium acetate,
 *        carbon dioxide, and water.
 *
 *        It is my hope that high school students of chemistry and computer
 *        science will  use this code as a starting point to create more
 *        fun ways to learn.  Thus, I give my permission to any and all to
 *        copy and modify this code in any way you wish.  I would love to
 *        see a version of it using the the Unity or Unreal engines.
 *
 *        Converted to Delphi August 2022
